   # or
   node dist/bin.js
   ```

## üìã Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/your-feature-name` - New features
- `bugfix/issue-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/what-you-changed` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/component-name` - Code refactoring
- `test/what-youre-testing` - Test improvements

### Commit Message Format

We use **Conventional Commits** (and our own tool for this! üéâ):

```bash
# Use CommitWeave itself for commits
npm start
# or manually follow conventional format:
# type(scope): description
```

**Examples:**
```
feat(cli): add new AI provider support
fix(git): resolve staging issue on Windows
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(core): add unit tests for CommitBuilder
refactor(utils): simplify configuration loading
```

### Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
3. **Write or update tests** for your changes
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run typecheck
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Commit using CommitWeave**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:local
npm run test:cli
npm run test:perf

# Run VS Code extension tests
cd vscode-extension && npm test
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests** for utilities and core logic
- **Integration tests** for CLI workflows
- **Performance tests** for critical paths
- **Extension tests** for VS Code integration

Test files should be placed in:
- `tests/` for main CLI tests
- `vscode-extension/test/` for extension tests

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards

- **Strict TypeScript** - All code must be properly typed
- **No `any` types** - Use proper type definitions
- **ESLint compliance** - Follow our linting rules
- **Prettier formatting** - Code will be auto-formatted

### Code Structure

- **Single Responsibility** - Functions and classes should have one clear purpose
- **Descriptive Naming** - Use clear, self-documenting names
- **Error Handling** - Provide helpful error messages
- **Documentation** - Document complex logic with comments

### Performance Considerations

CommitWeave prioritizes **fast startup times**:
- Use **lazy loading** for heavy dependencies
- Minimize **startup overhead**
- Profile **cold-start performance** with `npm run bench`

## üé® VS Code Extension Development

### Extension-Specific Setup

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run build

# Test extension
code . # Opens VS Code
# Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
```

### Extension Guidelines

- **Follow VS Code standards** - Use official guidelines
- **Test in both themes** - Dark and light mode compatibility
- **Webview security** - Follow CSP and security best practices
- **Publisher compliance** - Ensure marketplace standards

## üêõ Reporting Bugs

### Before Reporting

1. **Search existing issues** - Someone might have already reported it
2. **Try the latest version** - The bug might already be fixed
3. **Check documentation** - Make sure it's actually a bug

### Bug Report Template

**Use our issue template** or include:

- **OS and version** (Windows 11, macOS 13, Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Node.js version** (`node --version`)
- **CommitWeave version** (`commitweave --version`)
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs **actual behavior**
- **Error messages** (full stack traces if available)
- **Configuration files** (sanitized, no API keys)

## üí° Suggesting Features

### Feature Request Guidelines

- **Search existing requests** - Avoid duplicates
- **Explain the problem** your feature would solve
- **Describe your proposed solution**
- **Consider alternative approaches**
- **Think about implementation complexity**
